# TODO:  
Define simple shared interfaces (when possible), and implement them for the different protocols.  

# Shared DAO Interfaces?  
Initially DAOstack, Aragon, and Colony may have very different: data formats, functional primitives, abilities. Overtime the idea is that functionality may converge in some areas, and in others it'll show differentiators in their architectures.  

A downside to this is that protocol creators have to implement their own implementation into this library. This can possibly be where semantic / dynamic reading & writing can shine. Unknown DAO protocols could be rendered through a default semantic interface (if they have mappings).
